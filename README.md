# AIG-Ransomware-Decryption

## Objective
The AIG Ransomware Decryption project is a certificate path created by AIG Cyber Insurance. The primary focus was to research the Log4j vulnerability, email the team that would be affected by this vulnerability, and then write a python code to brute force the encryption code of a file that the adversary got to in the ransomware attack, mimicing a real-world attack scenario. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of a potential cybersecurity scenario that could happen in the workplaces and steps taken to remediate the event.

### Skills Learned
- Researching reported vulnerabilities and analytical skills in cybersecurity.
- Drafting clear and concise emails to affected teams on vulnerability remediation.
- Increased Python skills by writing a script for avoiding ransom payments through a bruteforce on an encrypted file.

### Tools Used
- Python 3.13 using IDLE editor to code a brute force on encrypted file.
- Microsoft Word for crafting email to product development team.
